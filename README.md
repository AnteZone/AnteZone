# 🔷 AnteZone

**AnteZone** is a next-generation decentralized, open-source, on-chain broker platform built on the **Polygon** blockchain. We're building a global, trustless, and transparent Web3 poker & gaming ecosystem that eliminates traditional barriers and brings full control back to the players.

## 🚧 Development Phase

AnteZone is currently under active development.  
Our team is working hard to build a robust and secure platform from the ground up. Once development is complete, **all source code** will be publicly available in this repository.

Yes — we mean **everything**.

## 📂 Open Source Commitment

AnteZone is committed to being **fully open-source**.  
Every single line of code, every module, every component — will be hosted right here on this GitHub under AnteZone rights. We believe in transparency, collaboration, and the power of community-led development.

Whether you're a dev, a contributor, or just someone curious — you’ll have **full offline access** to the entire codebase once released.
